ytADL is a wrapper around yt-download with sane defaults. It was designed first and foremost to automate downloads for your favorite channels and halfway through programming it I added several useful features.. I have found the tool to be great for archival purposes. You'll never have to worry about things like a DMCA takedown, or a channel removing content you missed again.
